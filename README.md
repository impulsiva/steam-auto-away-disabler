# steam-auto-away-disabler
Disables Steam's Auto-Away functionality by sending "Online" status changes in every 5 minutes.

Just a quick script, so probably the "Away" defusing notification will be broken if the last defusing was in range of 45-59 in minutes.

# Constants in the code
300 = 5 minutes in seconds. Change as you wish.

15 = the time between two inactivity checks of Steam.
